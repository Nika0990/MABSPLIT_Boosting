MABSPLIT Boosting

This project extends the FastForest framework (https://github.com/ThrunGroup/FastForest)
with MABSplit, a novel split search strategy using multi-armed bandit techniques.

FastForest provides efficient implementations of decision tree and forest algorithms.
This project builds upon that foundational work while introducing new optimizations
and experimental features for tree-based learning.
